        <p><br>The senior design project that I am part of is creating a door sensor that does not have a replaceable battery or wired in power. We have decided to use a blend of RF harvesting to power a "heartbeat" microcontroller transmitter combination and Channel State Information (CSI) collection and processing. I am in charge of facilitating all meetings, and I work on the CSI side of the system. We have not gotten very far with CSI because we just decided to use it alongside RF harvesting, so I have not learned much about it. Although, in the future I am anticipating learning about data collection and processing and machine learning.</p>

      <h2>"Completed" Personal Projects</h2>
      <p>Is any project ever truly completed?</p>
    <br>
      <h4>Google Home Assistant Connected Light</h4>
        <p>Previously I had made a light switch bypass device that allows me to toggle my lights through a local website. In November of 2019 I decided that I would rather be able to use my Google Home assistant to control my light through voice commands. I did some research and found a service called gBridge that allows me to add devices to their service and control them through MQTT commands. Implementing their service did allow me to connect to the Google Home assistant, but there were still problems with a stable connection. To fix that problem I added another local web interface that allows me to see the serial output for debugging and pass the On/Off commands.</p>
      <h4>Wifi Enabled Light</h4>
        <p>An ESP8266, a relay, and a light switch were all I need to make my bedroom light switch controllable by phone or any other internet connected device. The controller has a local website that allows me to click the light on or off using the relay to bypass the existing switch.</p>
	    <h4>Bass Shaker for Desk Chair</h4>
        <p>This is the only project that I have done so far that has only been hardware. I started with a Dayton Audio puck and a basic audio amplifier. This quick setup worked quite well except that everyone could hear my music, shows, or any other audio out of my desktop. This problem got me a couple compaints from my roommates about the noise levels, so I then built a low-pass filter that allowed me to feel the lower frequencies without my roommates hearing the higher ones. The audio circuitry knowledge I have gained from this project will help me with my ongoing Audio Spectrum Analyzer.</p>
      <h4>This Website</h4>
        <p>This website is one of the projects that I have done and still am doing, as you can see by the work in progress indicator at the bottom of the page. I grabbed this website's domain during my sophomore year of college somewhere around winter break. Since then I have been using it to further my knowledge of website development.</p>
